# Pyhton-API-script-for-getting-Giantbomb-Video-game-data


This example demonstrates how to combine multiple data sources (raw
data and Web API). Here we generate a bar chart containing video game consoles
of multiple generations and their respective prices.

We use the API provided by Giantbomb.com as a data source for the available
video game platforms. Since prices there are only stored in the amount of money
you had to put on the table back when the console was released, we also want
to put those prices into perspective with the current value of the US Dollar.
For this we use the CPI made available by the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis.
